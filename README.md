# Thesis — Jonas Rodrigues Lima Gonçalves

This repository contains the thesis **"Enhancing Argumentation Structure Parsing
with Deep Probabilistic Answer Set Programming"**, developed as part of the
Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of São Paulo.

## Abstract

This work investigates the use of **probabilistic logic programming** as a tool
for enhancing argumentation structure parsing, with a focus on **Deep
Probabilistic Answer Set Programming (dPASP)**. The objective is to replace the
integer programming-based coherence enforcement step in Stab and Gurevych's
argumentation parsing pipeline with a dPASP-based approach. By leveraging dPASP's
capabilities for probabilistic modeling and integration with neural networks, the
project aims to develop a more flexible and potentially more accurate method for
ensuring the coherence of extracted argumentation structures.

The thesis explores how symbolic reasoning, enhanced with probabilistic
semantics, can offer more explainable and flexible scene classification compared
to traditional purely statistical models. In addition to studying the
theoretical foundations, the project includes an implementation and evaluation
of the proposed method.
